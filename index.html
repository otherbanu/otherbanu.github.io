				<h1>I build products by getting in the weeds to create cross-functional teams united by strategy. </h1>

				<p><h3 class="inline">Vision first.</h3> If I‚Äôve learned anything through my entrepreneurial ventures (an astrology app, a bike messenger company coming on its tenth anniversary, a cult publishing project), it‚Äôs that effective working relationships are built through a cohesive shared vision. By aligning on long-term strategy, people can build consensus on tactics and get things done more quickly and effectively‚Äîand it feels like we can win.</p>

				<p><h3 class="inline">Everything interesting comes from cross-disciplinary collaboration.</h3> Complex problems are best solved by people with different orientations. Data, design, and engineering are three sides of the same coin, three different ways of articulating what a product is. If marketing thinks there‚Äôs an obvious solution that engineering doesn't want to work on, there‚Äôs usually something that one of them doesn‚Äôt understand‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs how the database is structured, or what the marketing team is actually asking for. Without trust and an approach of curiosity, recognizing this is impossible.</p>

				<p><h3 class="inline">The user is looking at this thing while they‚Äôre driving a car.</h3> Drunk. Our product needs to be easy-to-use, or something might happen to the little old lady crossing the street. My academic background in psychology grounds me in both quantitative (analytics, tests, surveys) and qualitative (user testing, interviews, ethnography) research methodologies to deeply understand what users want and need. If it isn‚Äôt easy to use, it won‚Äôt be used.</p>

				<p><h3 class="inline">Less talking, more doing.</h3> Being a generalist in the intersection between design, data, and technology allows me the flexibility to step in wherever there are bottlenecks in the process‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs writing production code, designing anything from full app concepts to marketing pages, diving into analytics and running A/B tests, writing copy for a marketing page, or creating a project management system.</p>

				<p><h3 class="inline">The future comes at us fast.</h3> We need frameworks that let us move with it. Solutions must be built through a dynamic process of hypothesis-driven experimentation, where each hypothesis targets measurable indicators for revenue, experience, or other goals. We need to learn as much as we can, as quickly as possible. Otherwise, we'll be stuck living in the past.</p>

				<h1>I‚Äôm not a big believer in process that is followed for the sake of itself. A process is put in place by people, and that if it doesn't facilitate the actual work, then it's in the way. I instead adhere to a general set of principles that guides the work I do. </h1>

				<h3>LEARN</h3>
				<p>Through qualitative and quantitative research, lean into the ambiguity to learn about the problem and its context to really understand the core tensions and ambiguities. Without an openness to being wrong, an admittance of any kernel of bias, and deep-seated curiosity, this is impossible. </p>
				<h3>HYPOTHESIZE</h3>
				<p>By arranging all of the facts into a single core narrative, it‚Äôs possible to see the question in its context. From there, we can create measurable objectives that transform abstract ambiguity into concrete experiments that will validate or refute this hypothesis. </p>
				<h3>EXPERIMENT</h3>
				<p>Through well-prioritized rapid experimentation, products can be built and iterated upon thoughtfully and strategically. Depending on context, a thoughtful solution may not be as important as a quick, practical, and cheap one.</p>
				<h3>CELEBRATE</h3>
				<p>Assessing success and failure over beers and snacks tends to build solidarity such that this process can be repeated to infinitum, or at least until the users have transcended the material plane and my clients' pockets are full of cash. </p>
